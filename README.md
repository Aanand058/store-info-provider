# Store-Info-Provider

This application is designed to retrieve data from two distinct files. The first file contains details regarding store numbers and their current status, while the second file contains information about ongoing offers on items within those stores, along with their corresponding store numbers. The application seamlessly processes this data and generates an output file that comprehensively presents the store numbers, their conditions, and current statuses. Throughout its development, the application adheres to rigorous C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring robust and organized code.
